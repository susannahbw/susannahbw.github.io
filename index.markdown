<p>We are a new and growing theoretical and computational chemistry group at Durham University. Our focus is understanding how the behaviour of photoexcited molecules (molecules that have absorbed light) can be influenced, or even controlled, through interactions with their surroundings.</p>

<hr class="solid">

<p>We are always keen to hear from potential new collaborators or group members. If you are interested in working with us, please get in touch.</p>
