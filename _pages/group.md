  <h1> Dr. Susannah Bourne-Worster </h1>
<p>Susannah is a computational chemist interested in understanding the photoexcited dynamics of molecules in complex environments. Having grown up a committed technophobe, Susannah was first introduced to programming and the joys of theoretical chemistry during her MChem project on ‘Localisation of Polarons in Conformationally Disordered Polymers’ under the supervision of Prof. William Barford at the University of Oxford. She remained in Oxford to complete a DPhil in Theoretical and Biophysical Chemistry with Prof. Peter Hore, studying the effect of spin relaxation in the photoinduced radical pair reaction thought to underpin the magnetic compass sense of migratory birds. In 2018, Susannah completed her DPhil, got married (changing her name from Worster to Bourne-Worster) and moved to Bristol to take up an independent postdoctoral fellowship from The Royal Commission for the Exhibition of 1851.  During her fellowship, Susannah applied her expertise in Open Quantum Systems to modelling exciton transport in photosynthetic antenna and gained experience in TDDFT and semiempirical methods for excited states under the guidance of Prof. Fred Manby. In 2022, she moved to UCL to work with Prof. Graham Worth as a postdoctoral researcher on the collaborative UPDICE (Ultrafast Photo Dynamics in Complex Environments) programme between UCL, Bristol, Oxford and Imperial. In 2024, Susannah was successful in obtaining a Royal Society University Research Fellowship to build an independent research group. She took up her fellowship in January 2025 at the University of Durham, where she also holds a proleptic post as Assistant Professor in Computational Chemistry/Data Science. Outside of research, Susannah is a busy mother to an energetic toddler and enjoys singing, ballroom dancing, crafts and walking.</p>
